<p>Travelling has always been one of my great passions. When I was 17, my brother and I made a challenge to visit over 50 countries before we turn 25. At this time we did not know that the Covid pandemic would make this edeavour a lot more difficult, but I still am hopeful we can reach this milestone. As of now, we have visited 42 countries across all continents and are eager to explore more. Above you can see a picture of myself in Columbia at the beautiful lakes of Guatape.</p>

<p>Throughout my life I have been very privileged that my parents have placed great importance on me receiving an excellent education. I grew in Germany attending an International School and moved to the UK when I was 15 years old. There I completed my last three years of highschool before attending the University of St.Â Gallen for my bachelor studies. During that time, I had the pleasure of going abroad twice for exchange semester. This allowed me to spend several months in Boston, USA and Medellin, Columbia. I thoroughly enjoyed both experiences and made memories that will last me a lifetime.</p>
